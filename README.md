Add a docstring that describes the program's function.
    In the editor, type the docstring as shown.
    As you type the three opening double quotes, PyCharm automatically provides the closing double quotes.
    You can press Enter to force a new line for formatting of your code, but the line break will not be considered to be part of the actual string.
Write code to take a user's input, then print it back to them.
    Press Ctrl+End to move to the end of the code, and press Enter until the insertion point is on line 5 as shown.
    Starting on line 5, add the following code.
    When the program runs, the user will type the name of the file to be analyzed. This statement assigns the variable user_input to whatever the user types in.
Add a print statement with a comment to explain the statement's purpose.
    Press Enter to advance to line 9, and enter the two lines shown.
    The first line, a comment, explains what the second line does.
    The second line prints the user's input to the console.
Run your Python script.
    Within the wordcount.py code window, right-click and select Run 'wordcount'.
    Note: You don't need to manually save the source code yourself. PyCharm automatically does this after any change.
    PyCharm opens the Run tool window at the bottom of the screen.
    Examine the Run window.
    Note: Many of the screen shots for this course were captured with PyCharm's Soft-Wrap setting enabled, to avoid truncating text. In this activity and others in this course, if text in the Run window is truncated on the right side of the screen, you might find it helpful to select the Soft-Wrap button to enable lines of output to wrap around automatically.
    In the Run window, you can see the command that PyCharm issued behind the scenes to run the Python interpreter (python.exe). The program file that you wanted to run (wordcount.py) was passed to Python.exe as a command-line parameter.
    Based on the source code you wrote, the Python interpreter created an executable program and ran it, and the running program has produced output in the Run window.
    The prompt you produced using the input( ) function is displayed in the Run window.
    Click in the Run window to select it for typing. Then type Testing input and press Enter.
    Verify that Python returned your input back to you.
    Note: Process finished with exit code 0 means that Python was able to exit the program without any errors. Other exit codes like 1 or -1 would indicate errors.
